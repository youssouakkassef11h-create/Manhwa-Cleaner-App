[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/blob/main/manhwa_cleaner.ipynb)

This project provides a powerful, automated tool for cleaning text from manhwa or manga pages and enhancing their quality, all within a user-friendly Google Colab notebook.

## ✨ Features

-   **One-Click Setup:** No complex local installation required. Just open the notebook in Colab and run the setup cell.
-   **GPU-Accelerated:** Takes full advantage of Colab's free GPU resources for fast processing.
-   **Automatic Text Detection & Removal:** Uses advanced AI models (PaddleOCR and LaMa Inpainting) to accurately find and remove text.
-   **Image Upscaling:** Integrates RealESRGAN to upscale the cleaned images, resulting in high-resolution pages.
-   **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Launches a Gradio UI right from the notebook, allowing you to easily upload and process your images.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Running this tool is as simple as opening a notebook and running a few cells.

### Instructions

1.  **Open the Notebook in Google Colab:**
    Click the "Open In Colab" badge at the top of this readme.

2.  **Run the Cells in Order:**
    Inside the Colab notebook, you will see numbered cells. Run them one by one, in order:
    -   **Cell 1: Setup:** This will install all the necessary libraries. It may take a few minutes.
    -   **Cell 2: Main Application Code:** This defines all the functions needed to run the cleaner.
    -   **Cell 3: Launch the App!:** This will start the Gradio web interface and provide you with a public URL.

3.  **Use the Application:**
    Click the public URL generated by the final cell to open the cleaner interface in a new browser tab. From there, you can upload your images and start the cleaning process.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The notebook performs the following steps:

1.  **Environment Setup**: The first cell installs all required Python packages and deep learning frameworks.
2.  **Code Definition**: The second cell loads the entire application logic, including the functions for text detection, inpainting, and upscaling.
3.  **Gradio Launch**: The third cell starts a web server using Gradio and creates a secure, shareable link that you can use to access the UI.

Enjoy a hassle-free cleaning experience!
